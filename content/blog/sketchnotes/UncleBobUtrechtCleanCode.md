During the two-day meetup I made sketchnotes of each of Uncle Bob's sessions, as well as the breakout sessions.
Below you can find all of them in chronological order, unaltered, along with a link to the recording of the meetup, and the session's timestamp.
Sadly the breakout sessions were not recorded. Where possible I will try and find a recording of the same talk at another meetup or convention.
Keep in mind that these sessions may have been altered since the recording that I link.
